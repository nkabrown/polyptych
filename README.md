**Studying while under quarantine**

In _Picturing Quantum Processes_ the authors place their work as an attempt to understand quantum theory using pictures and processes instead of symbols and states. I'm intrigued. But I perhaps don't have the liberty of neglecting "symbols and states" since I'm up to my ears in conceptual debt. While under COVID-19 quarantine I'd like to set to work studying from both perspectives at once.

## Plan

```
 symbols and states                    mathematical machinery            pictures and processes
 ------------------                    ----------------------            ----------------------
