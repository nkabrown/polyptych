**Suffering learning while under quarantine**

In _Picturing Quantum Processes_ the authors place their work as an attempt to understand quantum theory using pictures and processes instead of symbols and states. I'm intrigued. But I perhaps don't have the liberty of neglecting "symbols and states" since I'm up to my ears in conceptual debt. While under COVID-19 quarantine I'd like to set to work studying from both perspectives at once.

## Plan

Goal: Build mathematical machinery and think about concepts

## Symbols and States

_Mathematical Logic_ G. Tourlakis

How is the relationship of logical languages to proving similar to the relationship of programming languages to programming?

Well, logical languages and programming languages are both artifical languages.

"As far as reading or writing a formalized text is concerned, it matters little whether this or that meaning is attached to the words, or signs in the text, or indeed whether any meaning at all is attached to them, the only important point is the correct observance of the rules of syntax." – _Elements of Mathematics: Theory of Sets_, Nicolas Bourbaki

What is the alphabet of Boolean logic?

What is the difference between variables and metavariables?

What are the definitions of strings and substrings?

What is the definition of formula-calculation?

What are the procedural and recursive definitions of the set WFF?

## Pictures and Processes

_Picturing Quantum Processes_ B. Coecke, A. Kissinger

The book uses a diagrammatic language to describe and reason about quantum theory. I'm quite interested in how I might use a diagrammatic language to describe and reason about programs and programming.

"...in diagrammtic theories, it is natural to treat arbitary processes on equal footing with states. States are then treated just as a special kind of process, a 'preparation' process. In other words, there is a shift from focussing on 'what is' to 'what happens', which is clearly a lot more fun. This is very much in line with the concerns of computer science, where the majority of time and energy goes into reasoning about processes (i.e. programs), and states (i.e. data) only exist to be communicated by programs." p.11-12

"We call a structure consisting of all the 'allowed processes' and how these interact a process theory." These process theories are defined as a category; a collection of types (objects), a collection of processes (morphisms), and a composition operation to join processes together. Process theories focus on composition, systems interacting with other systems, and have an interaction logic.

Nice description of seeking an abstraction: "As the standard, Hilbert-space presentation of the theory comes as a packaged deal, it is therefore necessary to seek an alternative presentation that lets us tease out the important features from the incidental ones." Diagrams are the abstraction they will use to drop incidental features and focus on the important features.

## Mathematical Machinery

_Graph Theory and its Applications_ Gross, Yellen, Anderson

A Graph constructor should return a null graph and then the ADT of the Graph should provide a procedural way to build a graph.

What is the difference between an adjacency table and an incidence table? Is there a mapping that will transform one into the other?

Areas of application that I might wish to explore:

[Algorithmic Cheminformatics](https://cheminf.imada.sdu.dk/): Graph grammar chemistry where molecules are represented as graphs and chemical reactions as graph transformation rules.

* [Intro article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2016.0354)
* [From Category Theory to Enzyme Design](https://cheminf.imada.sdu.dk/novo-synergy/)

## Diary

Sickness is the law of the living.

Calling it the "Chinese Virus" hides the fact of our common humanity. "...the vision of the [stricken's suffering] could certainly still say a great deal to those who know how to look at it and do not recoil before what it shows of our common humanity."
