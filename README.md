**Suffering learning while under quarantine**

In _Picturing Quantum Processes_ the authors place their work as an attempt to understand quantum theory using pictures and processes instead of symbols and states. I'm intrigued. But I perhaps don't have the liberty of neglecting "symbols and states" since I'm up to my ears in conceptual debt. While under COVID-19 quarantine I'd like to set to work studying from both perspectives at once.

## Plan

```
 symbols and states                    mathematical machinery            pictures and processes
 ------------------                    ----------------------            ----------------------

        ↓                                                                           ↓

 Theory of Sets, Bourbaki                                                New Structures for Physics

```

Goal: Build mathematical machinery and think about concepts

## Symbols and States

_Mathematical Logic_ G. Tourlakis

How is the relationship of logical languages to proving similar to the relationship of programming languages to programming?

Well, logical languages and programming languages are both artifical languages.

"As far as reading or writing a formalized text is concerned, it matters little whether this or that meaning is attached to the words, or signs in the text, or indeed whether any meaning at all is attached to them, the only important point is the correct observance of the rules of syntax." – _Elements of Mathematics: Theory of Sets_, Nicolas Bourbaki

What is the alphabet of Boolean logic?

What are the definitions of strings and substrings?

What is the definition of formula-calculation?

What are the procedural and recursive definitions of the set WFF?

## Pictures and Processes

_Picturing Quantum Processes_ B. Coecke, A. Kissinger


## Mathematical Machinery

_Graph Theory and its Applications_ Gross, Yellen, Anderson

## Diary

Sickness is the law of the living.

Calling it the "Chinese Virus" hides the fact of our common humanity. "...the vision of the [stricken's suffering] could certainly still say a great deal to those who know how to look at it and do not recoil before what it shows of our common humanity."
