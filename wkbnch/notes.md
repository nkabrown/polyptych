# Notes

**powerset.py**

The Boolean operations on power sets include union, intersection, and complementation. The power set with these operations make up a Boolean algebra.

`chain.from_iterable` returns an `<itertools.chain object>`. Returning that would give me a little more flexibility in how to represent the power set.

Why `combinations()` and not `permutations()`?
